<em>Before I start, let me just set expectations for this post: I don’t have the answers. Writing this is as much an exercise for myself to figure out my perspective as it is to share it, but perhaps this will lead you to a platform to board your own train of thought.</em>

<em>Vector: Direction AND Magnitude</em>
</p>

Let’s talk about direction.

This is the very first topic I’m choosing to tackle, because it’s the backbone of several most important ones in my mind at the moment. It’s a hugely common issue that all of us face not just once but several times during our lives, especially during the transition periods: finishing school and deciding what to do next, leaving your first job and deciding what comes after.

A helpful push to motivate my writing this is timeliness: A lot of my friends are preparing for graduation within the next few months, and I will be facing the same situation in the next year myself. Most of us (including myself) aren’t sure where to go, what to do, and why to do it. The struggle is real.

I’m gonna come at this from the perspective of a young (actually not that young anymore AHMEGADD) Malaysian who is lucky enough to even have the luxury of options to choose from, since those are the only shoes that I’ve walked in. I won’t just brush off the fact that I’ve been far more lucky than a large proportion of people who don’t have the freedom to pursue what they please, but I hope you’ll stay with me nonetheless, because it makes sense to me that no matter who and where we are in the world, we all need to decide where to go before getting there. Precisely which options you have to choose from and what your motivations are will be different from mine, but hopefully some elements of this will be relatable to everyone.

Let’s back up a bit and consider a question which is deceptively difficult to answer:

How important is it to even choose my direction?

True or False? 
> "Lots of people go through life without ever figuring out their direction. There’s no “A-ha!” moment for most of us, where you suddenly realize that the answer is 42 and understand what to do for the next 60 years of your life (At least Ed’s got it figured out till he’s 70). Therefore, there’s no need to figure out our life’s goals. Instead, we can be satisfied just taking things as they come and making spontaneous decisions at every turn.”

You might argue that many people who have had “successful” lives managed to do so without having a direction, at least at the beginning. I can think of many times where I’ve heard an interviewer ask “How did you end up being so successful / getting into this line of work?” and the interviewee answers “It was totally unexpected, actually!”, then spins off into a charming anecdote of how they found themselves in a situation by chance and just went with the currents, never actually making a hard decision to move towards what they’re now successful enough to be interviewed about doing. This is possibly true, but I’ll address this later on. For now, let’s put this aside as I make a case for the opposing view:

Let’s be clear what “direction” actually means in the context of this discussion. I’ll use a picture, since they’re worth a thousand words yada-yada-yada. In the picture below, we’ve got a number of questions that illustrate different things we might struggle with related to direction:

<Spectrum of direction>
y4: The philosophical “What is my purpose in life”
y3: Should I be focusing on making myself happy, or should I work full-time as a volunteer to make others happy (regardless of whether it makes me happy or not)?
y2: What should I study in university?
y1: Should I go out with friends this weekend or stay in and study?
y0: “Yours sincerely,” or “Best regards,”?
</Spectrum of direction>

If you think about it, you’ll realize that actually, each item on the spectrum of direction is not necessarily independent from the others. Accepting a loose relationship between subsequent levels, it’s all essentially the same picture, zoomed in at different levels of micro- and macro-ness.

Now here comes the bit which I deem important:

It looks like choosing direction at a higher level could possibly help us with decisions at a lower level.

Does that make sense? Having a clear answer to questions at the top of the spectrum, gives us a solid foundation upon which we model our answers for the micro-level questions that we face on a daily basis. Looking at it this way, it might be better to draw this as a direction pyramid instead:

<Pyramid of direction></Pyramid of direction>

We are plagued with difficult decisions every day, but having a good grasp of our end-goal can help us to figure out our direction for the choices that matter and just as importantly, it allows us to not sweat the choices that don’t.

And that seems intuitive enough. Now for the hard part.

How do I figure out my direction?

Well, what did we just learn? It should be easy now that we know the approach! I can just figure out my highest-level beliefs, then let the answers trickle down and solve all of life’s problems!

Not so fast. What makes this hard, is that we don’t even know what is the right question to ask. We can take a look at a number of pretty high-level questions to start, but most of them aren’t easy to answer at all:

What is most important to you?

Is what is most important to me even what is most important in life?

What should I make the main purpose of my life?

Should I be maximizing my own happiness, maximizing the happiness of all living beings everywhere, focusing on other goals (etc religious).

Is happiness (and the whole bundle of good feelings that come with it – love, companionship, self-confidence) even the most important metric of a life’s worth? Or is there something more? Actually, this is a really interesting topic! Let’s discuss this in a future post.

These are not easy to answer. Attempting to rank priorities on a list, many cultures around the world accept a politically correct answer of placing family, friends, loved ones and general happiness near or at the top of the list. But despite outward agreement of these priorities, many people tend to make decisions that don’t quite follow the direction of these priorities. People don’t spend enough time with their families, work too long hours doing things they don’t enjoy, and rarely ever take the simplest path to what they claim to want out of life.

Does this mean that our whole “direction pyramid” model doesn’t work? Perhaps high-level beliefs don’t actually have such a solid control over our low-level choices after all.

I can think of an alternative. I think that people do have beliefs about what is most important to them, but we also have shortcomings, constraints and impedances that sometimes stop us from pursuing that main goal we decided upon.

One shortcoming that comes to mind is that we don’t have perfect information: We don’t necessarily know which is the best low-level direction which leads us towards a high-level goal. Let’s take an example and see how it plays out. Maybe I know that I want to become the next Gaston at Disney World, but how would I even get there? There are a million ways I could try to get there. Whether or not these methods will work is a different matter, but in fact, following through with this example, we see that imperfect information isn’t actually the biggest hurdle to people at least attempting to follow their directions. If this were the problem, we would see everybody pumping their biceps and sending metaphorical letters of intent to Disney World with photos enclosed. But we don’t, and I’ve just realized what I believe the biggest problem is: fear.

Alright, you got me – it’s not ‘fear’, it’s actually ‘hesitation’, but fear sounds so much more cinematic, it’s almost a cliche to say that fear stops us from following our hearts. But I’m gonna propose a slightly different twist, which is to say that our fear isn’t of failure, but of not being able to defend our beliefs in the eyes of others and ourselves. If we did truly believe in our directions, we wouldn’t be afraid to take as many failed steps as we can because falling flat in the right direction over and over again is still better than stepping successfully in the wrong direction.

No, the fact is that most people simply aren’t sufficiently convinced of their own beliefs. We know what society believes is important, but we haven’t really taken the time to work through the reasoning ourselves. As such, we’re stuck in a state of hesitation, and the only way to get out of it is to actually sit down and figure out what we want out of life.

Sadly as I told you right at the beginning, this is gonna be a cop-out: Everyone has to figure this out for themselves. (Unless you subscribe to the rather intriguing belief where there exists one globally optimal goal for the whole world which, if everyone sets as their primary goal, would lead to the maximum possible prosperity and happiness for the entire world and everything beyond. But I for one don’t know what this optimal goal is, so it’s almost a moot point to mention it here. Maybe you could make it your goal to work out what the optimal goal is! Can you prove that the optimal goal is to find the optimal goal? No, unfortunately. I tried, and it doesn’t check out.)

The only thing I can do at this point, is tell you my own beliefs, and maybe you’ll find some of it insightful:

I do believe it’s important to have high-level direction and beliefs. This doesn’t have to be anything concrete at all; in my case, I believe it’s a worthwhile effort to make the world (and universe) better. It’s as simple as two words: Do good. Maybe this is too simple for your taste, maybe it sounds too naive or cliched. But once you’re forming your beliefs based on what’s a cliche and what isn’t, you’d best check yo’self, son.

More recently, this direction of mine has started to trickle down, in ways both big and small – giving me a better idea of what I want out of a career, and in encouraging myself to be a better friend, neighbor or stranger to the people around me. It’s given me peace of mind in foregoing things that I know aren’t important to me, and fuels the excitement I feel when I look forward to ways I can do good in the future.

The exact terms of my beliefs might change one day and the finer points of my direction are still fuzzy, but this isn’t a bad thing, to me. Leaving room for uncertainty is important, it’s what keeps life exciting. This leaves room for the kind of chance events that change the course of your life like I mentioned earlier, and also keeps me on my toes being thoughtful and updating my direction as I learn and grow. When people ask me where I see myself in 10 years, I like to answer “Hopefully I’ll be somewhere, doing something that I can’t even conceive of right now,” because right now, as young as I am, I haven’t got everything figured out yet. There are a lot more things I need to learn and explore, and I believe there’s plenty of room to do so within the core of my direction to do good.

On the count of career decisions, I strongly believe that decisions like which job to take, which course to study, shouldn’t be and aren’t nearly as important as knowing what kinds of things you want out of life. What’s a waste of time so long as it’s time spent refining your direction – even if it is by the process of elimination? This doesn’t mean that you passively sit back and wait to “discover your passion”, but we shouldn’t be afraid to actively try out different things and taste enough of those things to “develop our appreciation” of what we find important.

At the end of the day, contrary to what society tells us, we do have the option of just trying things out. Making mistakes, and deciding further down the line that we don’t want to continue what we started *.

*At this junction, a lot of readers will stop me and say, “Yeah but I can’t afford to spend RM700,000 and 4 years just to find out that I don’t like engineering.” And of course that’s true, but there are many other ways to try things out without doing a degree in it. This is just the tip of an iceberg that I feel very strongly about, so you can rest assured that I’ll have a lot of things to say on the matter in a post of its own.

<quote>No matter how far down the wrong path you are, it’s always better to turn back than to keep going.</quote>

Life also isn’t a race, we shouldn’t compare ourselves to others who are on steadier paths than ourselves and feel bad. This is the very reason that people are afraid to take chances and try different things – fear that they’ll fall behind others from their high school peer group and feel unaccomplished, perhaps missing the “get married at 30 and have grandkids before you’re too old to see them” train. Let me just remind you that no matter when you get on any train, the journey’ll be a heck of a lot more enjoyable if you’re looking forward to where your train is headed.

Okay. So what does this all leave us with?

A lot to think about, that’s for sure. But essentially, what I’m saying is this: If you haven’t figured it out yet, don’t panic. Keep figuring until you know that you don’t have to panic.

<KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON>
