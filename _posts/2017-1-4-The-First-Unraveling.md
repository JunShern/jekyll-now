title: The First Unraveling
---

*A quick heads-up: This post will be something of a word diarrhea. After many years of not writing anything even remotely self-reflective, this first post will serve as a psychological sounding board for me to find my voice again. As such, the content of the article is honest but without any particular point, much like a drunken-uncle-twice-removed at a wedding. I plan to make future posts more focused and structured, so do come back for those if that’s more your style.*

I’ve decided to start writing again. This is not a snap decision, not something that I decided to start simply because a new year calls for new ventures (though I must admit I am a sucker for the romantic notion of fresh starts and shiny resolutions). I’ve decided to write again because things inside my head have been tumultuous, to say the least.

I’ve been less than honest with others and also myself, biting back unpopular opinions or passing on popular ones for the sake of convenience and likeability. In a gasps-of-horror, buzz-worthy nutshell, I can even say that I’ve gone as far as taking up a new religion for the sake of fitting in. But in reality, it was more complicated that just that. And that’s a topic for another day.

My economics teacher Mr Troy always encouraged us to constantly consider the third hand in an argument. In other words, given a dichotomy, consider both sides of the coin, flip back to the first side and discover a new feature in the picture. Then go back to the other side, reveal some new truth, and repeat ad infinitum. This is something I’ve found myself doing often, to my own detriment. I’ve kept silent to the extent of coming across as antisocial, all the while courthouses erupt into chaos inside my brain, calling back plaintiffs and defendants for a third, fourth, fifth trial without the jury coming to a decision. Most times the moment in reality passes before my internal gavel ever sounds, and in the eyes of others, I remain silent.

I withdrew quite deeply into a shell, and spent a long time being a much different person from whom I once was. In certain, special circumstances with the right people, I would emerge and feel comfortable being myself, but in other situations I have tried so hard to slip through the cracks unnoticed that those who did notice would have seen me as socially inept, a weirdo. The vastly different experiences I’ve had in these situations gives me the impression that the impressions that different people have of me are vastly different as well - and being human as I am, thus molded by how people regard me, I too am confused about what kind of a person I really am.

To tell you the truth, a part of me is actually worried about what I would find if I were to let myself just type freely and honestly without any internal censorship or editing - I worry that I would hate the person who emerges. Even more so, I worry that my friends would hate the person that emerges. But maybe it is fair to say that I cannot easily separate myself from that internal censorship, and so the censorship is a part of me. So I wonder, is our true self the one that exists before the censor is applied, or after it?

<em>After I thought of it, I had little doubt that such an image would exist. The Internet does not disappoint.</em>

Then again, I might be just making a mountain out of a molehill. Censor or not, perhaps I am really not all that messed up, and it’s just my over-thinking and habitual dramatic sentence-forming that makes knots out of imaginary rope. 

*A hypothesis: If we accept that our brains work even somewhat similarly to a text-recommender system (read this fascinating article on deep learning), what we say will be heavily dependent on what we hear and read. If I randomly type words, my English-speaking autopilot will kick in and just fill up a sentence with whatever sounds right, and to my brain, what sounds right is a cumulation of prose from the novels I read or television series I watch - likely with more dramatic dialogue than my actual thoughts and feelings. If that is the case, we must very carefully weigh the truthiness of each word we utter, lest we become actors of a persona other than our own. *

Abrupt: To give some sort of resolution to today’s drift around the currents of my mind, here’s a nice, structured list of what I hope to achieve with this new journal:

Discover more about myself, and have a stable understanding and peace with who I am.

Solidify my opinions. 

Open up discussion with my readers, and in doing so, hopefully open myself up to people and put myself in a position where I am more likely to end up having more conversations which matter. 

For the reader, I also hope to post content of a less selfish nature such as experiences or lessons which I believe are transferrable to others, interesting topics which deserve more attention, or even something purely educational when I learn about something cool. 

And finally, I leave you with the obvious choice of imagery:
