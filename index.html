    <h1>Hi!</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a maker, programmer and 3rd year Electrical and Electronic Engineering student at Imperial College London. 
        Particular interests of late include Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Robotics. 
        However, I'm generally enthusiastic about all making / programming / electronics-related topics 
        (with a particular soft spot for projects at the intersection of art and technology),
        so do get in touch if you'd like to collaborate on a project or chat about any of my existing work!
